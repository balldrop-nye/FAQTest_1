                                       We sell tickets to New Year's Eve parties in Times Square with guaranteed views of the ball drop directly from the venue, as well as tickets to parties in the Times Square viewing area that have a history of letting guests exit to see the ball drop and then re-enter the party. We also sell passes that give you access to parties at multiple venues in Times Square, which is fun because it lets you move around the area and to various parties. And we sell tickets to other fun New Yera's Eve parties that are not in the Times Square area, including a number of cruises. We have parties that are for adults age 21 and up, and parties that welcome all ages.</p>

Alternatively, we sell tickets for parties in Times Square that will allow you to enter the Times Square area much later (as late as 8pm on NYE) and give you access to area parties that will have food, drinks, and music leading up to the ball drop at midnight.<br><br>The Times Square New Year's Eve Ball descends from a flagpole at the top of One Times Square, which is located at 7th Ave, between 42nd St &amp; 43rd St. It can be seen along Broadway, from 41st St to 50th St, and along 7th Ave, as far north as 59th St.</p>
